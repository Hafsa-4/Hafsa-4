# Hi, I'm Hafsa 👩‍💻
Aspiring DevOps Engineer and AWS Cloud Enthusiast passionate about building secure, scalable, and automated cloud environments.

I am currently training with Full Stack Academy in AWS and DevOps, where I have gained hands-on experience in deploying, automating, and managing infrastructure using AWS services such as EC2, S3, Lambda, CloudFormation, and VPC. My journey is driven by curiosity, persistence, and a love for solving real-world problems through automation and cloud-native solutions. I enjoy working with Linux, scripting, and DevOps tools to streamline operations and improve efficiency.

## 🚀 What I Do
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Designed and deployed a highly available VPC with public and private subnets across multiple Availability Zones, configured secure networking with Internet Gateways and NAT Gateways, and integrated RDS MySQL databases for secure data storage.
- **Automation**: Written Bash scripts to automate repetitive tasks, manage processes, and control user access, reducing manual effort and improving reliability.
- **CI/CD**: Set up Jenkins on AWS EC2, installed JDK, and created freestyle jobs to automate deployments and shell scripts.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Exploring Terraform and CloudFormation to provision and manage infrastructure consistently.
